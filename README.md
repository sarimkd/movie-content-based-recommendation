# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Content-Based Movie Recommendation System repository! This project focuses on building a recommendation system for movies based on their content characteristics. By analyzing movie genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews, the system generates personalized movie suggestions for users.

## Introduction

Recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users discover content that matches their preferences. Content-based recommendation systems leverage the inherent features of items and user preferences to provide personalized suggestions. In this project, we develop a content-based movie recommendation system using a dataset containing information about movies' genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring the dataset, extracting essential information, and preparing textual data for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Using techniques like tokenization and stemming to convert textual data into numerical features.
3. **Vectorization:** Transforming the extracted features into numerical vectors, creating a representation of each movie's content.
4. **Similarity Calculation:** Computing cosine similarity between movie vectors to measure content-relatedness.
5. **Recommendation Generation:** Implementing a function that suggests movies based on their content similarity.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information about thousands of movies, such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gazu468/tmdb-10000-movies-dataset).

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sarimkd/movie-content-based-recommendation.git
cd movie-content-based-recommendation
```
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the project's app script:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

The recommendation system can be used to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. Simply provide the title of a movie, and the system will generate a list of recommended movies with similar content characteristics.

## Implementation Details

The implementation details, code explanations, and step-by-step walkthrough are provided in the [notebook](notebook.ipynb).

## Results

The effectiveness of the content-based movie recommendation system can be measured by evaluating the relevance of recommended movies to users' interests.
